# Draw-T

This code draws a T on the console where you want. You need to give the X and Y positions and the size of the T letter. 
If you give a too big it will ask you to give an other position. 
And the size of the T needs to be between 4 and 10 and it needs to be an even number if you give a wrong number it will ask you again until you give a correct number. 
At the end, you will see a T on your console.

To run this code you need to copy the program.cs and paste it into your C#  console application.
